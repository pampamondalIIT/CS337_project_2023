# CS337 Course Project 

Aim is to convert the hand-signs to text, to help with the accesibility for the needful.
Create a modular code that can be trained on any sign language and that can have a multiple class, so whole things is reuseable and only we need to provide 
the dataset in correct format.
Also final aim will be to detect handsigns from a live video given to that model.
